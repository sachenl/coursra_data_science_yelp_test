Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
              /*select count(*) 
                  from attribute*/
i. Attribute table = 10000 
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table =  10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table =10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 distinct records for primary key 'id' in business table 
ii. Hours = 1562 distinct recoreds for foreign key business_id in hours table
iii. Category = 2643 distinct recoreds for foreign key business_id in hours table
iv. Attribute = 1115 distinct recoreds for foreign key business_id in hours table
v. Review = 10000 distinct records for primary key ‘id’, 9581 user_id foreign key, 8090 business_id foreign key
vi. Checkin = 493 distinct records for foreign key ‘buisness_id’
vii. Photo = 10000 distinct records for primary key ‘id’, 6493 buisness_id foreign key
viii. Tip = 537 distinct records for foreign key ‘user_id’, 3979 buisness_id foreign key
ix. User = 10000 distinct records for primary key ‘id’
x. Friend = 11 distinct records for foreign key ‘user_id’
xi. Elite_years = 2780 distinct records for foreign key ‘user id’

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:No
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT *

FROM user

WHERE
      id IS NULL OR
      name IS NULL OR
      review_count IS NULL OR
      yelping_since IS NULL OR
      useful IS NULL OR

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg: 3.7082

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	The lower chart shows the review_count vs fans. It looks la more review_count does not means more fans as the max fans 497 item had 968 reviews which is far less than the top reviews 2000.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

city picked: Gilbert
category picked: Food
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
yes         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Based on the results, we can see that there seems to be a correlation between the location of the business and their rating. The business that are probably located in the same neighbor have close rating. Also they have similar working hours. Moreover, the business that have longer working hours usually have higher rating. 

SQL code used for analysis:

select b.name, b.city, c.category, b.stars, h.hours, b.review_count, b.postal_code
from business b 
inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id
inner join hours h on b.id = h.business_id
where b.city = 'Mesa' 
group by b.stars;
+-----------------------------+------+-----------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+
| name                        | city | category                    | stars | hours                | review_count | postal_code |
+-----------------------------+------+-----------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+
| Ghost Armor SS Springs      | Mesa | Mobile Phone Accessories    |   2.0 | Saturday|10:00-21:00 |            3 | 85206       |
| Cash Time Loan Center       | Mesa | Check Cashing/Pay-day Loans |   3.0 | Saturday|9:00-18:00  |            4 | 85210       |
| Eklectic Pie - Mesa         | Mesa | Gluten-Free                 |   4.0 | Saturday|11:00-22:00 |          129 | 85204       |
| Health For Life: North Mesa | Mesa | Cannabis Clinics            |   4.5 | Saturday|9:00-20:00  |           16 | 85215       |
| Green Corner Restaurant     | Mesa | Restaurants                 |   5.0 | Saturday|10:30-22:00 |          267 | 85210       |
+-----------------------------+------+-----------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
The business is still open has high rating stars.       
         
ii. Difference 2:
The business is still open has more reviews.         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
select b.name, b.is_open, c.category, b.stars, h.hours, b.review_count
from business b 
inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id
inner join hours h on b.id = h.business_id
where b.city = 'Mesa' 
group by b.is_open;
+-----------------------------+---------+--------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+
| name                        | is_open | category                 | stars | hours                | review_count |
+-----------------------------+---------+--------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+
| Ghost Armor SS Springs      |       0 | Mobile Phone Accessories |   2.0 | Saturday|10:00-21:00 |            3 |
| Health For Life: North Mesa |       1 | Cannabis Clinics         |   4.5 | Saturday|9:00-20:00  |           16 |
+-----------------------------+---------+--------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
 Finding correlation between the stars and the fans of the user as well as the useful of the the review.
       
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
 It looks like there is no clear relationship between fans stars and useful.                          
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
+------+-------+--------+
